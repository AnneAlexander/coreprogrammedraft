# Welcome to the CDH Learning Core Programme Cookbook! 

This collection of techniques and recipes is designed to be used alongside the CDH Learning Core Programme sessions. Instructors teaching on the Basics sessions and Workshops we run in this programme will be using the resources here during their teaching, but they are also published here for anyone to use. This is an open source textbook for the CDH Learning Community (and anyone else interested in digital humanities methods). 
We’ve called it a Cookbook for a number of reasons. 
Like any recipe collection, you may want to dip in to find the instructions on how to make something which takes your fancy, rather than follow a complete course on souffle-making from scratch. 
But just like the classic cookbook authors, we know that some of our readers will need to learn the ‘how-to’ before attempting some of the more complex recipes, so we provide cross-references and recommend you do have a read through the **Basic methods and tools chapter** if you are new to Digital Humanities methods. 
If you want, you can build your own pathway through the materials to progress from basic to more advanced techniques [add links to pathway chooser / flow chart] 
Finally this is a collaborative, living work which reflects our practice in teaching and researching DH. It is constantly evolving and developing. 

## How to read the Cookbook: 

There are two ways to view the cookbook. 

1. on Github, where you can see all the editing history and jump straight into the different folders
2. on the Cookbook website, where the chapters appear as web pages. 

The content is the same in both places, it is just presented differently. 

We’ve built the Cookbook on Github so as to manage the process of editing, publishing and managing the datasets and code associated with the Core Programme more efficiently. If you’re new to using Github we hope this will give you an added reason to learn how to navigate the platform. 

### Introductory chapters

>This section will introduce some of the foundational methods, tools and concepts you need to make the rest of the recipes work. 

_Basic methods and tools [Folder] [To be added MT 2023]_

>These two sections provide an introduction to two popular programming languages. You can read both, but if you’re new to programming we recommend you choose one to get started. Thematic chapters will include exercises and demonstrations in one or other of the two languages so you may want to pick one of those as a goal to work towards (we’ve added labels to highlight which language is used in each chapter).

_Thematic chapters_

>The library of thematic chapters will grow over time as new workshops are developed. For those readers who are following a progression pathway in one of the programming languages and want to try out the hands-on coding activities we recommend you attempt the introductory chapters first. However, the thematic chapters also have no-code activities and explanations which you can read without having to write a single line of code.

- Social media data analysis [Folder] [To be added LT/ ET 2024]

_Advanced chapters_

>This section of the Cookbook is aimed at those who have gained some experience in coding already and want to develop their practice. It introduces techniques to help you better manage your code and data, and develop your project into a usable, sustainable, and reproducible workflow for research.
